Project Description :
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we
are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about
these algorithms is visualization.

Thatâ€™s why we are making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms
work and also get a deep understanding of such sorting
algorithms.
